StringBuffer :
StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.
StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.
StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.0
example:

public class BufferTest{  
    public static void main(String[] args){  
        StringBuffer buffer=new StringBuffer("hello");  
        buffer.append("java");  
        System.out.println(buffer);  
    }  
}  

StringBuilder: 
StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe. 
It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.
StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.
StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5

example:
public class BuilderTest{  
    public static void main(String[] args){  
        StringBuilder builder=new StringBuilder("hello");  
        builder.append("java");  
        System.out.println(builder);  
    }  
}
